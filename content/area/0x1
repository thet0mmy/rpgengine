Welcome to Tommy's RPG engine demo
This is the title screen area, 0x1.

To enter the demo go east (type 'e').
I have no idea what happens if you go any other direction because there are no collision rules;
however I can only imagine that it has a lot of segfaults and zeroes if you exit the game bounds.
In this demo I try to prevent people from going out of the map with lore but it is entirely possible.

You are responsible if you do that :D
