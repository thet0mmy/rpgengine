You wake up in a field with horse-drawn carraiges moving past you, almost completely unaware of your presence. You have no idea how long you have been there but it
looks like a long time. You grip your bronze dagger that has fallen next to you (which is a tradition to leave behind on fallen soldiers) tightly in your hand. To
the north there seems to be a massive cloud, but you can't see more from your position.
Things you can do: 

     Cross the road (type 'e')
     Follow the road north (type 'n')
     Take the dagger (type 't')
     A corner of the wall that turns away to your west corners here blocking off the road with guards.
     A thick forest is behind you, however a large stone kingdom wall blocks you.
