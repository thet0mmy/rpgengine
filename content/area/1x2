You run up the road north. Up here you catch up with the carraiges. They look like they are going very slow for some reason. Perhaps they are afraid?
You try to open up your mouth and talk but they ignore you. It's like you're not even there. You walk up the road and see that it is heading into some very distant
foggy mountains. There seems to be a large lightning strike or a beam of energy of some kind, it's like nothing you've seen before. While you look at it you can feel
your soul getting destroyed or something. You can't even explain how you feel other than decay. You have to force your eyes away from the light.

You can:
    Continue north
    Go out east off the road
